This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error in HTML: attempting to modify the innerHTML of an element that does not exist. The bug.html file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.html provides a corrected version using proper error handling and element existence checks.  The solution ensures the script only executes if the element exists, preventing runtime errors.
